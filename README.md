# 🎧 Spotify Playlist to MP3 Downloader + MP3 Tag Editor
This project helps you convert your private Spotify playlists into MP3 files by searching for matching videos on YouTube and downloading the audio. It also includes a separate script to batch-edit MP3 metadata (album, artist, genre, etc.), perfect for organising your files for an MP3 player.

**Why did I decide to do this project?**
I was manually downloading my Spotify playlists into an MP3 player, and it was getting too tedious 🤭. So I thought hmmm... maybe I can automate this, and it went well! 

### 📁 Project Structure
- **SpotifyPlaylistReader.py**  _→ Script to extract songs from Spotify and download them as MP3s_
- **MP3TagEditor.py**           _→ Script to edit tags (album, artist, genre) of MP3 files_

### 🔧 Prerequisites
Make sure you have these installed:

1. Python 3.9+
2. Install Python packages:
`pip install spotipy yt-dlp mutagen`
https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/#getting-started
4. Install FFmpeg (required by yt-dlp for MP3 conversion).
- **For macOS (with Homebrew)**:
`brew install ffmpeg`
- **For Windows**:
Download FFmpeg from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html and add it to your system PATH.

<br>

**Changes you MUST make to the code**: 
>**IMPORTANT❗️:** _Change `CLIENT_ID = 'id'` and `CLIENT_SECRET = 'secret'` (lines `10` & `11`) in the authentication section, to match your Spotify Developer Credentials._

<br>

Change `line 115` to match the path you want to dowload the songs to: 
```python
def download_as_mp3(youtube_url, song_name, output_folder='[ADD YOUR PATH HERE]'):
    safe_filename = clean_filename(song_name)
```

*Example:*
```python
def download_as_mp3(youtube_url, song_name, output_folder='/MyWindowsPC/Downloads'):
```
